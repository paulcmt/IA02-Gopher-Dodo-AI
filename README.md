# Board Game AI Challenge: Dodo and Gopher AI

The aim of this project is to create artificial Gopher and Dodo players capable of playing in an AI competition. 
This project was carried out as part of the IA02 (Problem-Solving and Logic Programming) course at the Compiègne University of Technology (UTC).

These two games were created by Mark Steere.

## Rules 
Both games are played on a hexagonal board. The implementation is freely inspired by *Red Blob Games [Implementation of hex Grid](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/)*.
